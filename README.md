# user_access_logs

In this project we created a new githib repository. We loaded data from two different csv files into the user access log.

Now we plan to:

Olivias tasks:
1.Clean id column in system_access to match employee_number
2.Join data to one master data frame

Jakes Tasks:
1.Filter master data to identify missing access records
2. Create a subset of records that are missing values

Courtneys tasks:
1.Use job title to fill in missing access records
2.Create a csv file with the updates needed to correct the records
